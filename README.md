# Hardcode-Tray
Fixes Hardcoded tray icons in Linux

The script will automagically detect your default theme, the right icon size, the hardcoded applications, the right icons for each indicator and fix them. All that with the possibilty to revert to the original icons.

For a better experience use [Numix icon theme](https://github.com/numixproject/numix-icon-theme).

### How to use
  1. Download the [zip folder](https://github.com/bil-elmoussaoui/Hardcode-Tray/archive/master.zip) or clone the repository
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/bil-elmoussaoui/Hardcode-Tray.git
  ```

  2. Install  `python3-cairosvg` or `inkscape`
    - Debian/Ubuntu : <br />
      `sudo apt-get install python3-cairosvg`<br />
      `sudo apt-get install inkscape`
    - Fedora : <br />
      `sudo dnf install python3-cairosvg`<br />
      `sudo dnf install inkscape`
    - Arch : <br />
      `sudo pacman -S inkscape`<br />
      `sudo pacman -S python-cairosvg`

  3. Install the patched version of `sni-qt` 
    - Debian/Ubuntu :<br />
      <pre>
      sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cybre/sni-qt-eplus
      sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
      sudo apt-get install sni-qt sni-qt:i386
      </pre>
    - Arch : <br />
      <pre>
      yaourt sni-qt-eplus 
      yaourt lib32-sni-qt-eplus-bzr
      </pre>
  You can  [build it](https://github.com/bil-elmoussaoui/Hardcode-Tray/wiki/How-to-build-Sni-qt) from source code if you are using an other distro (like Fedora).<br />
  The `sni-qt:i386` is used for 32 bits applications as Skype.<br />
  Teamviewer is also using the `sni-qt` package, however it is shipping its own version. Therefore this script also overwrites the version shipped by teamviewer with the patched one.
  4. Open the `script.py` using this command
  ```bash
  sudo -E python3 script.py
  ```
  You can use `--only` argument to fix/revert only one application, don't use the argument if you want to fix all applications your icon theme supports.
  ```bash
  sudo -E python3 script.py --only telegram,skype
  ```
  In order to get the names needed to fix only specific programs, you can look at the second column of [`db.csv`](https://github.com/bil-elmoussaoui/Hardcode-Tray/blob/master/db.csv). There you can find the corresponding name for the program you want to fix.

  5. Enjoy!
